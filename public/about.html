<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Mike Lawson. I've worked in Marketing for about 10 years at this point, and I've decided to make a career change. 
  I've always enjoyed the analytical, data, and problem-solving aspects of my work more than I've enjoyed driving marketing strategy.
So I'm learning to code.</p>

<p>I first learned HTML when I was 14 and didn't do much with it except make terrible Geocities pages with my friends. When I started 
  working in email marketing, I picked HTML back up and learned some basic CSS to style my pages.</p>

<p>Now I'm taking that knowledge and pushing it forward. I'm learning to actually code so I can make really cool stuff on the internet!</p>
