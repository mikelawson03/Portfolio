<p>Fun fact: I was watching this movie in my old apartment when the maintenance guy came in to do some work. He showed up right as "Finest Girl" started, and we stopped talking about the problem he was there to fix right as the line "Terrorize that pussy" happened. It was...awkward.</p>

<h3>Phantom of the Paradise</h3>

<h3>Cops!</h3>
